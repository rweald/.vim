This script is an improved version of  f.vim  (vimscript #318).

Improvements: folding depth is limited, previous fold settings can be restored, pattern is always the last search pattern.

Script uses manual folds.  The user's manual folds are not preserved (unlike vimscript #2302 does it).


Usage:

<Leader>z
fold away lines not matching the last search pattern.
With [count], change the initial foldlevel to ([count] minus one).  The setting will be stored in g:searchfold_foldlevel and will be used when [count] is omitted.

<Leader>iz
fold away lines that do match the last search pattern (inverse folding).

<Leader>Z
try hard to restore the previous fold settings



Customization:

:let g:searchfold_maxdepth = 7
(number) maximum fold depth

:let g:searchfold_usestep = 0
(boolean)
Per default, each "zr" (after "\z") unfolds 1 more line above the cursor, but several (= step) lines below the cursor.  Set this var to 1 to get the same amount of lines above the cursor.

:let g:searchfold_postZ_do_zv = 1
(boolean)
If 1, execute "zv" (view cursor line) after <Leader>Z.

:let g:searchfold_foldlevel = 0
(number)
'foldlevel' to set for <Leader>z and <Leader>iz

:let g:searchfold_do_maps = 1
(boolean)
Whether to map the default keys or not.
